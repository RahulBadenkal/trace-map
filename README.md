# Given a shape
# Total perimeter
# A map
-> Return the route on the given map

Map
Graph, nodes = intersections, edges = weighted distances

Shape
Shapely shape

1. A function to convert a map to a graph
2. A function that returns the distance between to shapes
3. a function that generates all possible paths from the graph given a starting and ending point
4. Add penalty for repeating edges
